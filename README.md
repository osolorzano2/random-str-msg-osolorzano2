# random-str-msg

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g random-str-msg-osolorzano2
```

# Usage

```bash
 random-str-msg
```

# Contributing

If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: [random-str-msg](https://github.com/osolorzano2/random-str-msg-osolorzano2)
